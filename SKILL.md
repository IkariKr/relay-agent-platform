description: Delegate coding implementation to Claude Code while Codex keeps responsibility for task decomposition, review, verification, retry prompts, and git commits. Use when the user asks Codex to break down a coding task, have Claude Code execute the concrete changes, inspect Claude's diff, ask Claude for fixes if needed, and commit only reviewed changes.

# Codex Delegate Claude

Use this skill when Codex should be the planner, reviewer, verifier, and committer, while Claude Code performs bounded implementation attempts.

## Workflow

1. Define the finish line.
   - Restate the user goal, deliverable, success criteria, and constraints.
   - Identify the relevant files, commands, and likely tests before asking Claude to edit.
   - Keep implementation instructions specific enough that Claude does not need to infer scope.

2. Record the baseline.
   - Run `git status --short` before delegation.
   - Record pre-existing dirty files separately from files expected to change.
   - If the repository is not a git worktree, continue without commit behavior and state that limitation.

3. Delegate one bounded implementation attempt.
   - Prefer the bundled wrapper:
     ```powershell
     & "$env:CODEX_HOME\skills\codex-delegate-claude\scripts\run_claude_delegate.ps1" -Prompt "<implementation prompt>"
     ```
   - If `CODEX_HOME` is unset, use the absolute skill path or the discovered skill directory.
   - The wrapper calls Claude with `claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits --output-format json`.
   - The prompt to Claude must include:
     - the exact user goal,
     - files or areas Claude may edit,
     - relevant constraints,
     - verification commands Claude should run when appropriate,
     - an instruction not to commit.

4. Review Claude's changes.
   - Inspect `git status --short` and `git diff`.
   - Check for scope drift, unrelated edits, missing tests, broken public interfaces, and unsafe behavior.
   - Run the smallest meaningful verification commands that can prove the change.
   - Treat Claude's summary as advisory only; Codex must verify from the working tree.

5. Retry only with concrete findings.
   - If the result is incorrect or incomplete, send Claude a targeted correction prompt.
   - Include exact review findings, failing commands, and the expected fix.
   - Keep a default limit of 3 total Claude attempts unless the user requested a longer loop.
   - Stop and report the blocker if repeated attempts fail for the same reason.

6. Commit only after Codex approval.
   - Stage only files from the current delegation cycle that Codex has reviewed.
   - Do not stage unrelated pre-existing dirty files.
   - If Claude touched a file that was already dirty before the cycle, inspect hunks carefully.
   - Commit that file only when the delegation changes can be isolated safely.
   - If isolation is ambiguous, stop and ask the user instead of committing.
   - Use this commit message form:
     ```text
     <short imperative summary>

     Implemented by Claude Code, reviewed by Codex.
     ```

## Claude Prompt Template

```text
You are Claude Code executing a bounded implementation task for Codex.

Goal:
<user goal and Codex decomposition>

Allowed scope:
<files, modules, or directories Claude may edit>

Constraints:
- Do not commit changes.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Follow existing project style and tests.
- Keep the change minimal and focused.

Verification:
<commands to run, or state "Codex will run verification" if not safe to run here>

After editing, summarize changed files, verification run, and any remaining risks.
```

## Review Checklist

Before accepting Claude's result, verify:
- The diff directly satisfies the stated goal.
- No unrelated files or generated noise are included.
- Existing dirty files were not accidentally folded into the delegated change.
- Tests or checks cover the changed behavior, or the remaining risk is explicitly acceptable.
- The final commit contains only reviewed, intended changes from this delegation cycle.

## Bundled Script

Use `scripts/run_claude_delegate.ps1` for repeatable Claude invocation. It prints Claude output, captures stdout/stderr logs under the system temp directory, returns Claude's exit code, and prints the post-run git status summary. It never stages or commits files.
